# Intextual File Lang

Intext is a lightweight, Python-based scripting language focused on reading files and embedding structured text. Syntax is inspired by natural English.

## Current Features
- output statements (print statements)
- declare variables (int, string, bool) (variable declaration)
- A decent error handling system (I gotta be honest)
- comment support (//)
- CLI-based parsing

## ðŸ“¦ How to Run
```bash
python3 parser.py <filename>
```
- Make sure to use the .itx file extension for it to work!
