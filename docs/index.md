# Welcome to Intext Docs ðŸ“–

This is the official documentation for Intext, a file-focused Domain Specific Language (DSL) designed for automation, scripting, and text operations.

## What is Intext?

Intext is a DSL designed for the purpose of quick manipulation of text and files. In fact, the name of Intext is a mash-up of ``index`` and ``text`` to describe it's focus on structure and content. \
***Features such as***
- Reading files
- Writing to files
- Appending to file
- Performing complex actions with multiple files

And more are expected to arrive or are already here.

## Get Started

Head over to to the [Intext Playground](https://playground.devhatch.site/) to start writing code; no intsall needed. Do note, that some functions were restricted do to privacy reasons. However, you can grab the latest, and most full-feature packed install in the Github.

### What to learn?
Click on one of the sections on the side bar. I recommend learning [Output](output.md) first to learn your first "Hello World" program!

## About the Creator

The one and only developer, and the one and only person making these documents, is the creator of Intext â€” Elemnto56. I built this slightly out of boredom, but along with the idea that I needed sometime quick to automate a lot of a proccesses regarding files. Most would say to learn Bash or Python, but I chose to make my own language. Along with the hope someone will enjoy it as much as I do.
